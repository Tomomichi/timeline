The West,2019,3,2,,now,,,,,DVG parts ways with high-profile hire,"Car dealer DVG has abruptly parted ways with its chief operating officer, little more than a year after he was hired from arch-rival Automotive Holdings Group.Japanese-owned DVG, which owns 24 multiple new-car dealerships in Perth, confirmed yesterday that Tony Salerno had left the group on Thursday and would not be replaced. The industry veteran, it said, had resigned with immediate affect for “personal reasons”.DVG said finance manager Tony De Lucia, who was recruited to the group by Mr Salerno, had left at the same time after his role was made redundant.Mr Salerno’s departure consolidates management of DVG with chief executive Takayoshi Udagawa and chief financial officer Dan Kawai, who have run the group on behalf of Tokyobased owner IDOM since the founding Divirgilio family surrendered management control a year ago.Mr Salerno was running AHG’s easyauto123 used car venture when he was lured across to DVG by former managing director Lou Divirgilio in early 2018 as part of the new leadership structure.At the time, DVG cited his industry and management experience.Yesterday, however, it said it had scrapped the chief operating officer role as “it transitions its structure to a model that provides its dealer principals with more autonomy and less operational control to manage their dealerships”.",,,,point,
The West,2018,2,24,,now,,,,,"WA recovery helps AHG lift
DVG chief shifts leadership gear","Automotive Holdings Group is seeing signs of improvement in WA’s new car market but wellreceived first-half results have been partly overshadowed by ongoing doubts over the sale of its refrigerated logistics arm.AHG shares rose as much as 6 per cent on the back of the results, which showed profit from its national network of car dealerships picked up markedly in the December quarter, driven in part by better sales in WA.“We’re seeing a decent change in momentum (in WA),” chief executive John McConnell said.The recovery is being led by sales of new vehicles to businesses, an area which is less profitable than private sales, but AHG expects the pick-up to broaden as WA’s economy and consumer The chief and co-founder of DVG Automotive is surrendering the management reins of WA’s second-biggest car dealer to the company’s Japanese owners.Managing director Lou Divirgilio, who founded DVG with his six brothers 22 years ago, will step down in March in favour of Takayoshi Udagawa to focus on his confidence improves.The State was “still a little down but overall people are buying and servicing cars in WA and used cars continue to go reasonably well”, Mr McConnell said.AHG’s net profit for the six months to December 31 fell 2 per role as chairman. Mr Udagawa has been working in DVG since Japan’s Gulliver International, now IDOM, bought the family business for $121 million nearly three years ago.The brothers retain 33 per cent of DVG, which has 24 car dealerships across Perth.The business is back in profit and riding a recovery in sales aftercent to $39.9 million and it would have been lower but for $18 million in cutbacks that almost offset a $23 million income hit from the regulatory crackdown on add-on insurance products and finance commissions.The automotive division some painful cutbacks forced on it last year.“All the hard work has been done in the past eight to nine months, we’re back in a good situation, and I’d just like to concentrate on the board,” Mr Divirgilio said.He is the last of the brothers still in an executive role at DVG.returned a 3 per cent profit fall to $75.3 million before interest and tax on an 8 per cent rise in revenue to $2.74 billion.However, investor questions to AHG yesterday were focused on the pending $400 million sale of its refrigerated logistics business to China’s HNA, announced in November.Doubts over the deal have emerged on the back of a financial squeeze which has forced HNA, a major shareholder in Virgin Australia, into a multibillion-dollar global divestment program.AHG said it was working with HNA to secure the “remaining” Chinese and Australian approvals needed to meet its June 30 deadline to close the deal.However, it declined to disclose what approvals may have already been given.“Can we unequivocally sit here and guarantee completion? No we can't, because we require two parties to do that,” Mr McConnell said. “We have less visibility in and around the (approvals) process in China.”AHG shares rose 17¢ to $3.62. as",,,,point,
The West,2017,8,26,,now,,,,,AHG hangs in but cuts loom,"Automotive Holdings Group is eyeing extra cost cutting across its WA network despite grabbing more of the local new car market in defiance of a painful four-year sales recession.Australia’s biggest auto retailer has been pulling costs out of its local business to offset a 22 per cent fall in WA new car sales since 2012 that has been blamed on the softer State economy and weak consumer confidence.“We've absorbed a fair amount of pain in terms of the reset of the WA business, but we've still got a bit more work to do,” AHG chief executive John McConnell said yesterday.The Perth-based group’s annual results, however, provided some unexpectedly strong encouragement for shareholders by revealing that its share of the WA new car market rose 2.2 percentage points in the year to June 30 to 23.7 per cent.The surge in market share will likely fuel increased speculation about the performance of AHG’s major rival, DVG, since the family-owned network was bought by Japan’s Gulliver International (now IDOM) two years ago.AHG’s bottom-line profit for the year to June 30 fell to $55.1 million from $90.1 million previously, as the group booked nearly $32 million of charges, including redundancy costs and restructuring expenses linked to its refrigerated logistics arm.Excluding the charges, operating earnings fell 10.2 per cent to $87.3 million as revenue rose 8.2 per cent to $6.1 billion.Mr McConnell, who took over from Bronte Howson in January, said AHG’s local sales margins had been pressured by several factors, including heavier discounts as dealers sought to move an oversupply of vehicles and a higher proportion of sales going into less-profitable fleet deals.The weak WA market, along with lower margins on car financing because of regulatory changes, was a major factor in the 5.1 per cent fall in its automotive earnings before interest and tax to $151.1 million. Revenue from car sales actually grew 10 per cent to $4.7 billion on the back of recent acquisitions.There was also a fall at the refrigerated logistics division after a major revamp, which has included the loss of nearly 200 jobs. The division’s profit more than halved to $2.8 million, with revenue dipping 3 per cent to $580.4 million.While refrigerated logistics will do better this year, AHG is tipping just a “modest” improvement in group operating profit “on expectations that the WA economy is stabilising” and flow-through from cost savings.The company’s shares fell 20¢ to $3.31 as AHG declared a lower final dividend of 9.5¢ for a reduced annual payout of 19¢.JP Morgan and Bell Potter upgraded the stock to overweight and buy respectively after the results.",,,,point,
The West,2018,3,10,,now,,,,,DVG sale crash not a pretty sight,"The extent of the ugly sales collapse at Perth car dealer DVG Automotive has been laid bare in filings belatedly lodged with the corporate regulator.DVG’s Japanese owner,IDOM, has already disclosed DVG’s fall into the red on lower sales in its own yen denominated filings.The numbers don't look any better in Aussie dollars.DVG parent Buick Holdings’ 2016-17 financial report shows the auto group fell to an$8.4 million loss in the year to February 28, 2017, on revenue of just $378.8 million.In its last full year before the seven Divirgilio brothers sold 67 per cent of DVG to IDOM for $121 million in September 2015, DVG made $4.6 million on revenue of $632 million.Little wonder the now IDOM-managed group attacked its costs with such urgency last year, cutting nearly 100 jobs and revamping management.DVG is now back in the black and riding an emerging recovery in car sales in WA.It took the company two years to settle the matter, initially with a $33.3 million payment to the ATO in 2012 and a further $2.4 million payment in 2014.A noise complaint by a rock concert goer seems a bit unusual. Billionaire Andrew Forrest being the apparent target of the unhappiness is even stranger.Observers saw Forrest rocking out on Tuesday night at The Queen + Adam Lambertmusical, light show and graphic extravaganza at Perth Arena.The Fortescue Metals Group chairman was said to have led some enthusiastic dancing from the corporate box of his family-funded Minderoo Foundation. Not content with insisting his own guests rise and jiggle, Forrest urged others in neighbouring boxes to follow suit.Not all punters were happy, however, with at least one complaint received claiming loud and unruly behaviour from one of the boxes. mother, goes one saying. And that appeared to be the case when the corporate regulator’s operatives tried to break former Antares Energy boss James Cruickshank’s mother when they called on her at home in Peppermint Grove in the hope of serving papers on her son.The encounter between mum and Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s Vincent Gineste and a colleague identified only as “Ms Lim” was detailed in an affidavit filed with the Federal Court last week.Ms Lim: Is James here? Mother: No, he’s not here and I don't know where he is. He’s not staying here.Ms Lim: Is he in Perth? Mother: Yes. I have spoken to him and passed on your message and contact details.Ms Lim: Do you know where he’s staying?Mother: No and I don't have to tell you anything.Mr Geneste: Yesterday you told us that he would be staying with you.Mother: I don't know where he’s staying in Perth.Fortunately for mum and ASIC’s troops, the court has ruled that ASIC can effectively serve Cruickshank by posting and emailing the paperwork to him in the US.ASIC wants the former Australian Army officer fined and banned as a company director, alleging he and Antares breached disclosure rules with a September 2015 stock exchange announcement trumpeting a deal to sell two oil and gas permits for more than $US250 million.Perth’s biggest social media conference, State of Social, was launched this week.Organised by Meg Coffey,who founded social media networking group #SMPerth,the hashtag-strewn event will be held at Optus Stadium on June 26.The three major topics of influence, behaviour and innovation will be put under the microscope and about 500 of WA’s communicators, marketers and business owners are expected to take part in the event.Visit stateofsocial.com.au for more information. with Sean Smith, Stuart McKinnon and Helen Shield",,,,point,
The West,2015,9,17,,now,,,,,Dealership Divirgilio finalises $121m sale,"WA’s Divirgilio family yesterday finalised the $121 million sale of a majority stake in its DVG Automotive network of car dealerships to Japanese group Gulliver International.The sign-off came two months after the announcement of the sale and was marked with a ceremony at DVG’s foundation dealership in Maddington.The deal gives Tokyo-listed Gulliver 67 percent of DVG’s operating company, Buick Holdings, for $120.6 million and is expected to see the WA business expand onto the east coast.The cash will be divided between the seven Divirgilio brothers, Lou, Dominic, Robert, John, Stephen, Michael and David, who will continue to manage DVG and its 10 locations.Established in 1996, the DVG network covers 25 new and used car dealerships in Perth, turning over $700 million a year.Following the deal, Buick’s board has expanded with the addition of a Gulliver nominee, Michael Divirgilio and corporate adviser Clinton Bradbury.",,,,point,
