Cancelled,2000,,,,2000,,,,,JC2Sat-FF,"JC2Sat-FF is joint formation flying microsatellite mission of CSA (Canadian Space Agency) and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency). JC2Sat-FF consists of two nearly identical microsatellites, each of ~ 18 kg (they are also referred to as nanosatellites), that are stacked in launch configuration and will be separated using their own intersatellite separation mechanism after separation from the launcher and initial checkout operation.",https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/j/jc2sat-ff,http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13GOKmO522bgcSAv5-x0SZZH19SqZKfev,,,blue
Cancelled,2000,,,,2000,,,,,Rascal,"Rascal is a two-spacecraft mission designed by St. Louis University to demonstrate key technologies for proximity operations and space situational awareness: infrared imaging, 6DOF propulsion, RF proximity sensing, and automated operations. It consists of two 3U Cubesat spacecraft fastened to a common baseplate; the system launches as a single 6U",https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/rascal.htm,,,,green
Cancelled,2000,,,,2000,,,,,DelFFI,"The objectives of the DelFFi mission are threefold:

Demonstrate autonomous formation flying using various Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) architectures.
Facilitate students with hands-on experience and cutting-edge technology.
Characterize low thermosphere with enhanced scientific return by using distributed observation on various geometric baselines.",https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/delffi.htm,http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=14NGUneD39tShDnuxg9FpdlqEywkdlfYv,,,green
